# FAQ

**Q:** What is CBC?

**A:** The [COIN-OR](http://www.coin-or.org/) Branch and Cut code is
designed to be a high quality mixed integer code provided under the
terms of the [Eclipse Public License](http://opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-1.0.php).
CBC is written in C++, and is primarily intended to be used as a callable library
(though a rudimentary stand-alone executable exists). The first
documented release was .90.0. (JF 04/01/05)

**Q:** What are some of the features of CBC?

**A:** CBC allows the use of any CGL cuts and the use of heuristics and
specialized branching methods. (JF 04/01/05)

**Q:** How do I obtain and install CBC?

**A:** Please see the [Cbc website](https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc)
for details on how to obtain and install COIN-OR modules.

**Q:** Is CBC reliable?

**A:** CBC has been tested on many problems, but more testing and
improvement is needed before it can get to version 1.0. (JF 04/01/05)

**Q:** Is there any documentation for CBC?

**A:** If you can see this you have the best there is:-) Also available
is a list of [CBC class descriptions](http://www.coin-or.org/Doxygen/Cbc/) generated by
[Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org). (JF 04/01/05)

**Q:** Is CBC as fast as Cplex or Xpress?

**A:** No. However its design is much more flexible so advanced users
will be able to tailor CBC to their needs. (JF 04/01/05)

**Q:** When will version 1.0 of CBC be available?

**A:** It is expected that version 1.0 will be released in time for the
2005 [INFORMS](http://www.informs.org) annual meeting. (JF 04/01/05)

**Q:** What can the community do to help?

**A:** People from all around the world are already helping. There are
probably ten people who do not always post to the discussion mail list
but are constantly "improving" the code by demanding performance or bug
fixes or enhancements. And there are others posting questions to
discussion groups. (JF 04/01/05)

A good start is to join the coin-discuss [mailing list](http://www.coin-or.org/mail.html) where CBC is discussed.
Some other possibilities include:

  - Comment on the design
  - Give feedback on the documentation and FAQs.
  - Break the code, or better yet -- mend it.
  - Tackle any of the "to-dos" listed in the Doxyen documentation and
    contribute back to COIN-OR.
